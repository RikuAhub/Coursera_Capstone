The Battle of Arenas

Lets say that we are going to make a trip to New York and want to visit NHL game outside of Manhattan. As I know my wife isn't a such NHL fan so she want other things before or after the game. I want to use Prudencial center and Barclays center location and convert it to longitude/latitude with geopy then usen Foursquare location data to make analysis which neigbourhood is better place to visit, go eat in good restaurant and maybe grab a drink or two after the game.

Things to do in short:
1. Import important python libraries
2. Convert arena addresses to coordinates with geopy
3. Get restaurants and Food & drink from Venue Category that I near Prudencial center and Barclays center (arenas as clusters)
4. Find top 5 restaurants and food & drink from both locations
5. Make asumption that there where is better combined userscore for top 5 restaurants is better place to visit.
